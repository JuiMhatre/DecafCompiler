# How to Compile and Execute

This repository contains a collection of `.frag` and `.decaf` files in the `samples` folder. You can compile and execute these files using the provided scripts.

## Compilation

To compile the code, run the following command in your terminal:

./build.sh


This will generate an `a.out` file, which is the executable.

## Execution

To execute the compiled `a.out` file with the input files in the `samples` folder, run:

./exec.sh


This will generate the output based on the input files.

## Capture Output

If you want to capture the output to a file, you can run the following command:


./exec.sh out.txt


This will redirect the output to a file named `out.txt`.

Feel free to explore the provided `.frag` and `.decaf` files and modify the scripts to suit your needs.
